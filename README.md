## Introduction

This project is a hands-on application of responsive web design principles to create a card layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Inspired by Dave Gray's tutorial on [CSS Responsive Card Design for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpYtrgB3b6o), this mini-project aims to showcase the power of CSS in creating flexible and responsive web components.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a responsive card design that:

- Maintains its integrity across various devices.
- Utilizes media queries to adapt to different screen resolutions.
- Implements a mobile-first approach for better performance on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

## Features

The responsive card includes the following features:

- A header section with a title and subtitle.
- An image that scales with the card size.
- A content area for descriptive text.
- A footer with social media links or call-to-action buttons.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Use a live server extension or open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the project.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring the card design is fluid and scales well between breakpoints.
- Optimizing images for faster load times without compromising quality.
- Balancing aesthetics with functionality to maintain a user-friendly interface.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of:

- The importance of responsive design in modern web development.
- How to effectively use media queries to create adaptable layouts.
- The role of flexbox in building structured and flexible designs.
